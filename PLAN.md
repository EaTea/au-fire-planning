# Plan

This is the living plan for building the Australian FIRE Planner. It is
written against [`requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md`](requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md)
and the [desktop mockups](requirements/mockups/README.md).

**Current status:** drafting the plan. No implementation has started.

| Part | Contents | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Order in which the requirements are delivered (this document) | Agreed |
| 2 | Tech stack, architecture and testing approach | Not started |
| 3 | Step-by-step plan for the first milestone (M0) | Not started |

## 1. Requirement ordering

### Principles

1. **A working app after every requirement.** Each requirement lands as one
   or more small commits. Each commit leaves the app building, its tests
   passing, and every screen built so far usable. Each milestone ends at a
   point worth merging, so **each milestone is one PR**.
2. **Thin vertical slices.** A milestone adds inputs, calculations and
   outputs together, so each one visibly extends the mockup screens instead
   of building a layer that can't be used yet.
3. **One new dimension at a time.** The model starts as simply as possible
   (one person, one portfolio, no tax). Each milestone then adds a single
   dimension: time, drawdown, Coast FIRE, super, couples, tax, then
   property. Couples come before tax, so tax is built per person from the
   start rather than retrofitted.
4. **Must first, then Should, then Could.** Phase 1 (M1–M14) delivers every
   Must requirement, which is the minimum viable product. Phase 2 (M15–M21)
   adds the Shoulds and Phase 3 (M22–M24) the Coulds. One Should is pulled
   forward: TAX-9 (tax-free threshold and low income offsets) goes into M8,
   because without it the tax on early retirees' low incomes would be wrong.
5. **No mixed kinds.** Every milestone after M0 is a behavior change. If a
   refactor turns out to be needed, it goes in its own PR before the
   milestone that needs it. To avoid the most likely refactors, the model
   holds lists from M1 (a household with one person, a list with one
   portfolio), so adding a partner or more portfolios later extends the
   model rather than reshaping it.

### Applies to every milestone

- **Tests (NFR-6):** unit tests for every calculation, using worked examples
  checked independently, plus an E2E test for each new user-facing flow.
- **Transparency and determinism (NFR-1, NFR-2):** every new figure can be
  traced to its inputs, and the same inputs always give the same projection.
- **Year-by-year projection (OUT-1):** starts in M2. Each later milestone adds
  its own columns.
- **Rules as data (NFR-3):** from M5, every statutory rate, threshold and cap
  is stored as dated data, not in calculation code.
- **Mockup conventions:** tables are editable in place, charts have hover
  tooltips, and values can be shown in today's or nominal dollars. Each
  convention applies from the milestone where the table or chart first
  appears. The inputs panel (mockup 05b) arrives in M16. Until then, inputs
  are edited through the steps.
- **Honest about what's missing:** until the MVP is complete, the app shows
  which parts of the model aren't built yet (for example "tax is not yet
  modelled"), so early results aren't mistaken for complete ones.
- **README:** install, build, run and test instructions stay accurate.

### Decisions

Agreed in review of part 1:

1. **Couples stay at M7.** The first milestones model one person.
2. **Property stays at M12–M14.** Until then, homeowners include housing
   costs in their living expenses.
3. **The MVP line is M14**, the end of Phase 1. Scenarios (M16) stay in
   Phase 2.

### Open questions

1. **Tech stack.** M0 depends on it. It will be proposed in part 2 of this
   plan, in its own PR.

### Next steps

- [x] Review and agree this ordering.
- [ ] Part 2: tech stack, architecture and testing approach (separate PR).
- [ ] Part 3: step-by-step plan for M0 (separate PR).
- [ ] Start implementation with M0, once parts 1–3 are agreed.
